# Divine Right: Coronation and Priest Nomination for Non-Catholics


## Features

This mod adds new religious doctrine, Divine Right, as an option for Pagan reformation and Random World starts.

Divine Right is incompatible with Temporal leadership, and adds up to three features to the religion:

- Catholic-style coronation ceremonies.
- Priest nomination, similar to Catholic bishop nomination with Papal investiture.
- Vassal Dukes and Kings pay homage to their liege. Disabled by default.

Each feature can be enabled individually for religions with the Divine Right doctrine, all Christians, or both.
